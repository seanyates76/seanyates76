# Hey, I’m Sean 👋🏾

I build tools that make learning and creation transparent, accessible, and a little bit smarter every time they run.
I’m currently maintaining **[EZ-Quiz](https://ez-quiz.app)** — an open, AI-assisted quiz generator built for clarity and trust.

## 🧭 What drives me

* **Human + Machine Collaboration:** I design workflows that make AI a genuine creative partner.
* **Clarity before complexity:** I build projects that teach as much as they build.
* **Sustainable focus:** Steady progress over frantic output — development as a long game.

## ⚙️ What I work with

Vanilla **JavaScript**, **HTML/CSS**, **Netlify Functions**, and growing experience with **AI-assisted development**.
I value precision, accessibility, and maintainability, guided by frameworks that reinforce security and clarity.

### 📜 About

Driven by curiosity, defined by clarity. I like to turn complex systems into approachable tools that anyone can understand. Whether I’m refining a UI, studying network security, or experimenting with generative models, my goal is always the same: make the process as elegant as the result.
